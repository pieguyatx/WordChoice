# Word Choice
A digital toy for words already said

This is a project to develop a game where you choose your own sentence one word at a time.  For version 0.1, the word choices provided from from the most popular sentences found on the internet in search engines.  The first words given also are based on popular first words in English-language novels.

Future versions or branches of the game could include giving words based on live scraping of search engine data to determine what the top next word choices are.  Alternately the word bank can just be expanded, or different word banks may become available based on a specific genre or learning goals, e.g. biology-related sentences for teachers to use in a biology class, or funny sentences to use to inspire an improv comedy show.  The game could also branch into other platforms beside the web.
