# Private repo for testing w/ Pius
#
# 11/19/2016 pw:
# I'm using this space to test out the private share option of github
# and to try making a small project to help me learn Javascript.  
# The project is a "digital toy" tentatively named "Word Choice" that
# let's you choose your own path one word at a time.  The choices are based
# on statements available on the internet.  Points will be given to the
# player/user depending on the uniqueness, age, and type of statement that
# results.
