# Private repo for testing w/ Pius

11/19/2016 pw:
I'm using this space to test out the private share option of github and to try making a small project to help me learn JavaScript.  The project is a "digital toy" tentatively named "Word Choice" that let's you choose your own path one word at a time.  The choices are based on statements available on the internet.  Points will be given to the player/user depending on the uniqueness, age, and type of statement that results.

The basics of the program are made.  Scoring will be added, and some design elements will be added, too.  Eventually I'll want to redo this so that the initial dataBuilder.js isn't there, and only the parsed JSON is there, so that the data isn't as easily reproduced.
